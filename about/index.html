Friendly, professional, reliable
I have been working as a designer since 1992 and have been freelance since 1998.

As a freelancer, I am able to give all clients individual attention and a fast reliable service. Lower overheads and the latest software guarantee a cost-effective project.

I have over 14 years experience of building websites, and can help plan, build and promote a site. I can design online and offline branding, optimise existing sites for usability and accessibility, increase search engine rankings and raise traffic levels.

With over 16 years experience in graphic design, I thoroughly understand print media from design to repro so can produce printed work aligned with your website. I offer a wide range of designs including logos, brochures, adverts, leaflets, magazines or business cards.

Prices are fair; advice is professional and based on current best practice.
